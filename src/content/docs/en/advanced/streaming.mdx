To use the `CannonHttpJS` library with streaming, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `CannonHttpJS` library:

```javascript
import CannonHttpJS, {
  ResponseData,
  ExtendedRequestOptions,
} from "@cannonui/httpjs";
```

2. Use the `stream` method to make a streaming request:

```javascript
const onDataChunk = (chunk: any) => {
  // Process each chunk of data as it arrives
  console.log(chunk);
};

(async () => {
  try {
    const response: ResponseData<unknown> = await CannonHttpJS.stream(
      "/streaming", // Replace with the URL of your streaming endpoint
      {

      } as ExtendedRequestOptions<unknown>,
      onDataChunk
    );

    // Handle the entire response after all chunks are received (optional)
    console.log("Streaming response complete:", response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error.message);
  }
})();
```

Please note that the `stream` method from `CannonHttpJS` will handle the streaming response and call the `onDataChunk` callback for each data chunk received. You can process the data in the `onDataChunk` callback or use the entire response data after all chunks are received, as shown in the example.

Make sure to replace `"/streaming"` with the actual URL of your streaming endpoint. Also, you can add more configuration options as needed.

Remember to handle any errors that might occur during the streaming process and adjust the example according to your specific use case.

The `isFormData` feature in CannonHttpJS will help you serialized to formdata format by CannonHttpJS automatically.This feature is useful when working with form data and file uploads.

1. Set the `isFormData` flag in the request configuration:

```javascript
CannonHttpJS.post(url, { data: { name: "John Doe" }, isFormData: true });
```

When making a request, if the `isFormData` flag is set to `true`, the request payload will be treated as a `FormData` object. That is, CannonHttpJS will help you serialized to formdata format by CannonHttpJS automatically.

2. If the request data as `FormData`:

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("name", "John Doe");
formData.append("age", 25);
formData.append("avatar", fileInput.files[0]);
```

Assuming you have form data, create a new `FormData` object and append the form fields and file inputs to it.

Pass the `FormData` object as the `data` parameter in the request configuration. CannonHttpJS will detect if the type of the data provided by you is an instanceof FormData. If it is, CannonHttpJS will leave it as is.

With the above setup, the request payload will be treated as a `FormData` object, enabling you to handle form data and file uploads correctly.

Note: This feature is specifically designed for handling `FormData` objects. If you are working with JSON data, and set `isFormData` to `true`, JSON data will be serialized to formdata format by CannonHttpJS automatically and sent as the request payload.

Example usage:

```javascript
import CannonHttpJS, {
  ResponseData,
  ExtendedRequestOptions,
} from "@cannonui/httpjs";

const url = "https://api.example.com/upload";

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("name", "John Doe");
formData.append("age", 25);
formData.append("avatar", fileInput.files[0]);

const formDataJson = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
};

CannonHttpJS.post(url, { data: formData })
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });

CannonHttpJS.post(url, { data: formDataJson, isFormData: true })
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, the `post` method is used to send the `FormData` object as the request payload to `'https://api.example.com/upload'`. The `FormData` object is prepared with form fields and a file input. The `isFormData` flag is set to `true` to ensure proper handling of the `FormData` object during the request.

Here's an example of how to use the retry mechanism with CannonHttpJS:

```javascript
import CannonHttpJS from "./CannonHttpJS";

// Set the maximum number of retries
CannonHttpJS.setRetry(3);

// Make a request
CannonHttpJS.get("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

The `setRetry` method allows you to set the maximum number of retries for failed requests made with CannonHttpJS. The `maxRetry` parameter specifies the desired maximum number of retries.

In the above example:

- The `setRetry` method sets the maximum number of retries to 3. This means that if a request fails, it will be retried up to 3 times before returning an error.

- The `get` request is made to `'https://api.example.com/data'`. If the request fails, CannonHttpJS will automatically retry the request according to the configured maximum number of retries and delay calculation.

Retry functionality can be useful in scenarios where temporary network issues or server errors may occur. It helps improve the robustness of your application and provides resilience against intermittent failures.
